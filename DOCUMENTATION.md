- **CSS Modules**: For styling.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: For building RESTful APIs.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: For storing data.

### Tools
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Postman**: For API testing.

## 4. System Architecture
The platform follows a client-server architecture:
- **Client**: Handles user interactions and communicates with the server via REST APIs.
- **Server**: Processes requests, manages business logic, and interacts with the database.

### Data Flow
1. User sends a request from the client.
2. Server processes the request and interacts with the database if needed.
3. Server sends a response back to the client.

### Component Interaction
- **Frontend**: React components interact with Redux for state management.
- **Backend**: Express routes handle API requests and interact with MongoDB.
